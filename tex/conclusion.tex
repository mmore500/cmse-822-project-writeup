\section{Conclusion}

Charm++ 
Message-driven paradigm would align nicely with existing software in our lab group designed for event-driven evolutionary computation \cite{lalejini2018evolving}.

However, this project seems to clearly indicate that MPI is the better path forward.
It's faster and allows better control.
Because MPI is much more ubiquitous than Charm++, it also benefits from better support and integration with other software, such as parallel I/O with HDF5.
Heavy-weight dependency.

Although Charm++ offers an appealing object-oriented and message-driven conceptual framework, MPI is the obvious choice.
